# Employee Polls Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
This project is to build an application that employees can use internally


Some descriptions of pages:

- Login: enter username/ password before making any action.
  Username in list ['hulk', 'ironman', 'blackwidow', 'captainamerica']. Default password for all is '123'.
  (username/ password matchs with mock-data in src/utils/\_DATA.js).

- Dashboard: home page, to new unanswered and answered polls, and user can pick option of unanswered polls.
  With answered polls, user can see the number of people as well as the percentage of people who voted for that option.

- Leaderboard: View ranking of user asked / answered the most questions (sum asked+answered polls).
